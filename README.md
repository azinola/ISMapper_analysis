# ISMapper_analysis
This repository contains a pipeline for the analysis of insertion sequences (IS) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using Illumina paired-end sequencing data. The pipeline allows the identification and analysis of insertion sequences in M. tuberculosis genomes starting from Illumina sequencing reads. 
Required inputs: 
• A file named list_is.txt containing the list of (IS) to be analyzed (e.g. IS6110) 
• A list of samples to be analyzed (e.g. SAMP1) The sample files must be located in a directory named samp/ and must be in format SAMP1_R1.fastq.gz and SAMP1_R2.fastq.gz.
Next steps: 
1. Include the genome of other mycobacteria
2. Increase the DB of IS
